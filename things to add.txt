1. make the tweetbox a fixed height that is larger;
2. make the tweet button cursor turn to "x" when the tweet is too long, also an alert or a sound?
4. make the newest tweet appear a bit different.


Learnings:
To make the list reverse, needed to add .reverse() before .map() [in both instances if we didn't add .reverse() to the handleLike function then it caused the newly LIKED tweets to map onto the end.]


Done.
3. make the tweets appear in reverse order
